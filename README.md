# New! Now with individual mugz_ui_mods
Original mod: https://github.com/mixMugz/msfs2020-uimod

I modified "tinyplates" and "hiddenui" to give the following features:
- Footys Nameplate is now blue and you can toggle Footys nameplate individually
- Changed the keyboard-shortuts to be more steam-friendly (F12 = Screenshot)
    - F9 = Toggle pilots nameplates
    - F10 = Toggle Footys nameplate
    - F11 = Toggle HUD in exteriour camera
- removed #1234 from pilots names

This version of mugz_ui_mods is working with SimUpdate III  (09.03.2021) as far as I know and tested.
I will continue to update this version, when there are updates to the original mods.
If something is not working correctly just use the original mod and talk to me after an event on the official MSFS-Discord.
And of course: I have talked to mixMmugz and have his permission to host the modified version here.
